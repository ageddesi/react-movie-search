# react-movie-search
 
This project was interesting for me, I have spent the last few years building react feature apps to be embedded inside of AEM (Adobe Experience Manager), as such I have not had the chance to use Next yet. I decided to use this framework on top of REACT to see what everyone is excited about. 

Outside of my work I use a framework called Redwoodjs which is an on rails experience for REACT websites on side projects.

Given more time on the project, I would have liked to create a second page that uses the graphql implementation instead of the REST endpoints. I would have also like to have added a like feature that would then using AI recommend additional movies you may like based on those.

I would also add a check to see if the cover image url is valid and returns and image. If not I would add a placeholder.

Lastly I would like to spend time working out how to use the REAST API to get a full list of all the genres so that I could pass that along with the search field, at the moment it will do a local filter only on the page your viewing.
