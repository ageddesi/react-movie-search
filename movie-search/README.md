## About the approach

This project was interesting for me, I have spent the last few years building react feature apps to be embedded inside of AEM (Adobe Experience Manager), as such I have not had the chance to use Next yet. I decided to use this framework on top of REACT to see what everyone is excited about. 

Outside of my work I use a framework called Redwoodjs which is an on rails experience for REACT websites on side projects.

Given more time on the project, I would have liked to create a second page that uses the graphql implementation instead of the REST endpoints. I would have also like to have added a like feature that would then using AI recommend additional movies you may like based on those selected.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
